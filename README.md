A panda's daily diet consists almost entirely of the leaves, stems and shoots of various bamboo species. Bamboo contains very little nutritional value so pandas must eat 12-38kg every day to meet their energy needs.Giant pandas live in a few mountain ranges in south central China, in Sichuan, Shaanxi and Gansu provinces.
