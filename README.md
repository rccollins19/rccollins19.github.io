A panda's daily diet consists almost entirely of the leaves, stems and shoots of various bamboo species. Panda's subsist almost entirely on bamboo, bamboo contains very little nutritional value so panda's must eat 12 to 38kg every day to meet their energy needs. Panda's need at least 2 different bamboo species in their range to avoid starvation. Male panda's are larger than female panda's, weighing up to 250 pounds (113 kilograms) in the wild. Females rarely reach 220 pounds (104 kilograms). Panda's are quite sleepy, panda's spend a big portion of their days snoozing. In fact, when they're not searching for their favorite food (bamboo) most panda's spend their days sleeping or lying around. For that reason, a panda may spend up to 12 hours a day resting or napping.
